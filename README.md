# FBLA-Computer-Game-And-Simulation-2023-2024
This is the repository for all of our game assets, files, programs, etc. 

This game was made using the Unity game engine, more specifically Unity 2022.3.9

It uses a steam ID of 480 (or something like that).

### Software Used:
	We used Unity as the game engine, along with visual studio code 2022 as the compilier.
	We used photoshop, inkscape, and gimp to create the sprites and UI elements.
	We used Github desktop to share this project.

### Libraries Used:
	Steamworks - Incorporate multiplayer to work with Steam
	FizzySteamworks - Allows Mirror to communicate with Steamworks, and thus Steam's servers.
	Cinemachine - Fancy Cameras.
	A* Pathfinding - pathfinding for enemies and NPCs.
